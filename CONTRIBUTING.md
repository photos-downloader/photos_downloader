Chinese pages live in `src/content/docs/`. English pages live in `src/content/docs/en/` and should use the same file names.

## Pull requests

1. Keep secrets out of commits. Review `git diff` before pushing.
2. Prefer small, reviewable documentation changes.
3. Run `npm run build` locally when you change config or add pages.
